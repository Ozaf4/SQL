# SQL

INTRODUCTION

This Repository demonstrates my skills and knowledge in using SQL to analyse and manipulate data from a database.

This is a project I have completed using SQL from the University of California Davis on Coursera. 
This project was the final asssessment as part of the '14 hour SQL for Data Science' Course.
I have provided the 'worksheet' with the questions and my answers, showing my Queries used and results tables.
I have also provided the Yelp Data Base Entity Relationship Diagram, which I used to run my queries and Analyses.
Lastly, I have attached the official certificate which I recieved for completing the course and project successfully.
